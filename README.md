#### ART is an EDA software tool that was developed by a group of EECE2023 students :  
###### - Aya Reda 
###### - Sohila Akram 
###### - Abd-El-Rahman Sabry 
###### - Abd-El-Rahman Mohamed Nour-El-Deen
###### - Abd-El-Aziz Mohamed 
###### - Abdullah Said

  The project aims to change the traditional way of developing RTL and testing its functionality, The software has three main stages Resources , Design-Test GUI and Output Stage you can also watch this bref [video about the software ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZPi7BEip8kASPovHhIC7xob7bcxjF_Fj?fbclid=IwAR1j0BXKvXnAWnTLyQNgx7maxk23PwvoUdbqZ8fcAoZBEP6FnwdnXkd6Q_4)

### Resources Stage
<br>
<br>
The resources stage is the verilog files source for our design in the next gui stage.
there are 3 main sources for verilog files in the software 

#### Standard library 

<br>
The standard library is used to generate verious configurable verilog files to be used in your design. For example: if you want to build a processor you will find memories, ALUs, Pipes ...etc 
<br>
<br>

#### External Verilog Files 

<br>
you can write a verilog file by yourself and then import the file into the design 
<br>
<br>

#### Finite State Machines 

The software allows you to draw the state diagram and it will generate the verilog file for the FSM but it still under development.
