### ART is an EDA software tool that was developed by a group of EECE2023 students :  
###### - Aya Reda 
###### - Sohila Akram 
###### - Abd-El-Rahman Sabry 
###### - Abd-El-Rahman Mohamed Nour-El-Deen
###### - Abd-El-Aziz Mohamed Gamal-El-Deen
###### - Abdullah Said

  The project aims to change the traditional way of developing RTL and testing its functionality, The software has three main stages Resources , Design-Test GUI and Output Stage you can also watch this bref [video about the software ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16u4fu3__i1OCJmS3Fb07G-D56OvBuErb/view)

## Resources Stage

The resources stage is the verilog files source for our design in the next gui stage.
there are 3 main sources for verilog files in the software 

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Standard library 

The standard library is used to generate verious configurable verilog files to be used in your design. For example: if you want to build a processor you will find memories, ALUs, Pipes ...etc 

<br>
<br>
<br>

## External Verilog Files 

you can write a verilog file by yourself and then import the file into the design 

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Finite State Machines 

The software allows you to draw the state diagram and it will generate the verilog file for the FSM but it still under development.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Design Test GUI Stage

You can use the files from the resources stage and by defining the inputs and outputs you can use them to build a schematic of your design and the tool will generate all the required verilog files.
<br>
*if the whole design is based on the std lib it will be always synthesizable*

## Testing

We can The Testing in ART has an analogy with control systems
